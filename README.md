### ðŸ§  Data Extraction And NLP Analysis

## ðŸ“Œ Objective

This project automates the extraction and analysis of article content from a list of URLs provided in Input.xlsx. It processes the text and calculates key sentiment and readability metrics. The results are exported to an Excel file, structured as per Output Data Structure.xlsx.
